NOPC

What is it?
-----------

NOPC (Nessus-based Offline Patch Checker) is a patch-checker for primarily Linux distribution and UNIX-based systems.
It is a shell script that utilises Nessusâ€™ nasls and gives instructions on what data is needed to be obtained from the system to perform to derive a list of missing security patches. This was developed for situations when network connectivity to the systems under review is not possible.


Latest Version
--------------

Details of the latest version can be found at the following URL:
https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/nopc/


Notes
-----
Should be able to run nopc.sh under Linux/Unix where Nessus has been installed.
If non-standard installation of Nessus or Mac OS X, need to define location of:
* nasl command line (option n)
* nasl plugins directory (option d)
Please see examples for more details.

Interactive mode where no options supplied with nopc.sh is self-explanatory.
It also gives a command line in case you want to repeat without interactive mode.
Examples of these shortcuts can be see under examples.
