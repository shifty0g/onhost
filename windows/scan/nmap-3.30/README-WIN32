The Win32 version of Nmap is still in an ALPHA/BETA stage of
development.  If you find bugs, you are strongly encouraged to report
them to fyodor@insecure.org or nmap-dev@insecure.org .  Patches are
very welcome too :).  

I would like to thank the following people for doing most of the Win32
porting work:

Andy Lutomirski ( Luto@mailandnews.com )
Ryan Permeh ( ryan@eEye.com ) from eEye Digital Security ( www.eeye.com )

Nmap only exists for Win32 because of their hard work.

*** Known Issues/Bugs ***

== You cannot scan yourself (localhost).  This is a Windows/WinPcap
   limitation which we haven't yet found a way to workaround.

== Nmap does not work under Windows ME .  This is a WinPcap
   limitation.

== RAS connections (eg PPP, SLIP, etc) are not supported except under
   Windows 2000.  This is a WinPcap limitation on NT and it isn't
   supported (yet) on Win98.  Ethernet should work fine on all platforms.

== All interfaces (except localhost) should work under Windows 2000 as
   administrator.  If you have trouble under Win2K, try the
   --win_norawsock switch.

== TCP connect() scan can be agonizingly slow.  You may have luck by
   adding a new registy DWORD value to
   HKML\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters named
   "MaxUserPort", with a large value like 65534).  See MS KB Q196271.


== NmapFE (the GUI front end) has not yet been ported to Win32 .

*** Using the Binary Distribution ***

There are a couple binary distributions of Windows Nmap.  One is
Winmap, which is packaged in an install-shield installation wizard and
includes a graphical GUI as well as command-line Nmap.  The other
distribution is the command-line zipfile, called
nmap-VERSION-win32.zip .  Here are the instructions for installing
this zip archive:

1) Make sure you have installed Winpcap Version 2.1-beta or later.  This
   is available at http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap/ .  It is
   very important that you use version 2.1-beta or later.  This is
   optional, but recommended, under Windows 2000.

2) Unzip the archive using Winzip or your favorite decompression
   utility -- a directory call nmap-VERSION will be extracted .

3) Open a command prompt (DOS) window and cd into the new nmap-VERSION
   directory.  Type "nmap -h" for usage information.  

*** Compiling the Nmap Source Distribution for Windows ***

1) Decompress the archive ( nmap-VERSION.tgz ).  This is the same
   tarball that is used for UNIX installations.

2) Make sure your Visual C++ compiler recognizes the .cc extension as
   C++ files.  This is done via the following registry modificuations
   (use regedt32 or whatever):

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\Text Editor\Tabs/Language Settings\C/C++ FileExtensions=cpp;cxx;c;h;hxx;hpp;inl;tlh;tli;rc;rc2;cc;cp 
HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1219703950-274334628-1532313055-1335\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\Build System\Components\Platforms\Win32 (x86)\Tools\32-bit C/C++ Compiler for 80x86 Input_Spec=*.c;*.cpp;*.cxx,*.cc,*.cp 
HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1219703950-274334628-1532313055-1335\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\Build System\Components\Tools\<Component 0x3> Input_Spec=*.c;*.cpp;*.cxx;*.cc;*.cp 

Note:  The numbers in the "S-1-5-21-*" keys above may vary.

3) Open Visual C++ 6 and then open the nmap workspace (
   nmap-VERSION/mswin32/nmap.dsw )

4) Project Menu -> Set Active Project -> Nmap
   Build Menu -> Set Active Configuration -> Nmap - Win32 Release

5) Press [F7] to build nmap.exe .

5) The executable can be found in
   nmap-VERSION/mswin32/Release/nmap.exe .  Remember that you must
   have Winpcap Version2.1-beta or later installed to run it (see the
   Binary Distribution instructions).

*** Compiling NmapFE Front-end for Windows **

1) Install the Windows versions of Glib, GDK, and GTK from
   http://www.gimp.org/win32/ .  Copy the DLLs somewhere that they can
   be found ( if you don't have a better place, try c:\winnt\system32
   ).  Also copy the include and .lib files to places where your
   compiler can find them ( add the dir to VC++ via Tools -> Options
   -> Directories ).

2) Use steps similar to the "compiling Nmap" list above to compile
   NmapFE.  The Workspace is in nmap-VERSION/nmapfe/nmapfe.dsw .

*** Final Worlds ***

As mentioned earlier, patches, suggestions, and improvements are more
than welcome!  Send them to nmap-dev@insecure.org or to me personally
( fyodor@insecure.org ).
